Scroll down to the line saying interfaces and update the line to say:

INTERFACES="wlan0"

This will make the DHCP server hand out network addresses on the wireless interface. Save the file and exit nano.

The last step in configuring the DHCP server is to configure a static ip address for the wireless network adapter. This is done in the file /etc/network/interfaces – before opening it make sure the WLAN interface is down. Do this with the following commands:

sudo ifdown wlan0
sudo nano /etc/network/interfaces

Should look like this:

auto lo

iface lo inet loopback
iface eth0 inet dhcp

allow-hotplug wlan0

iface wlan0 inet static
address 192.168.10.1
netmask 255.255.255.0

#
#
#

This will make the wireless adapter take the address 192.168.10.1 in our new local network. Remember to comment out the last 3 lines of the file.

This concludes the setup of the DHCP server – however we still cannot connect to our new network because we have not setup the access point yet. This is done by configuring the hostapd application. 

Next is /etc/hostapd/hostapd.conf instructions hostapd.txt.
