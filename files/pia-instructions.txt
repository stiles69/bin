    - and click "Edit Connections..."
    - then click "Add"
    - choose "Import a saved VPN configuration..." for the connection type from the drop down menu

    - choose which server you would like to setup and connect to

Note: Go back into the "Edit Connections..." and recheck all the settings.  Some times it seem to take setting the "AES-128-CBC" two times for it to stay set.  This might be a small bug with NetworkManager's import process.
